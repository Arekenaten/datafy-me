Supporting repository for the 'My Life in Data' NKU Honors Capstone project of Chase Miller

This project is an examination of the Node and Express JavaScript libraries alongside MongoDB Database to build a functioning API endpoint on the web. The purpose of this endpoint is to facilitate the collection of data via automated means to track data trends in my life, with the ultimate goal of visualizing and examining this data to alter these trends.
