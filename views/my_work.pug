    p My Life in Data is the name that I've given to my senior capstone at Northern Kentucky University. The project is a culmination of my academic experience so far and spans the final two semesters of my time at NKU. In the project, I am exploring the effect of having access to personal data on an individual's self awareness.
    p To begin the project, I took a series of courses by several fantastic web developers to learn Node.js, Express.js, Mongodb, CSS Grid, and other web technologies that are being used by web developers in the industry. Using this knowledge, I created the web-server, a database, and API endpoints that I can submit my personal data to. Using various other methods, I am now beginning to automatically collect data about my life and store it in my personal database.
    p The second phase of the project will be sifting through and visualizing my personal data. Hopefully, by using various data visualization techniques, I will be able to see trends and connections in the data. Using this knowledge, I hope to identify and solve problems in my own life that stem from connections between events in my life that I may not be able to see without the help of the data.
